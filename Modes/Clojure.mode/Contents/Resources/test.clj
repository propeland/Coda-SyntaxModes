(defn map-reduce
  "Performs a map-reduce job on the server.

  Mandatory arguments
  collection -> the collection to run the job on
  mapfn -> a JavaScript map function, as a String.  Should take no arguments.
  reducefn -> a JavaScript reduce function, as a String.  Should take two arguments: a key, and a corresponding array of values
  out -> output descriptor
      With MongoDB 1.8, there are many options:
          a collection name (String or Keyword): output is saved in the named collection, removing any data that previously existed there.
      Or, a configuration map:
          {:replace collection-name}: same as above
          {:merge collection-name}: incorporates results of the MapReduce with any data already in the collection
          {:reduce collection-name}: further reduces with any data already in the collection
          {:inline 1}: creates no collection, and returns the results directly

  See http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce for more information, as well as the test code in congomongo_test.clj.

  Optional Arguments
  :out-from    -> indicates what form the out parameter is specified in (:clojure, :json, or :mongo).  Defaults to :clojure.
  :query       -> a query map against collection; if this is specified, the map-reduce job is run on the result of this query instead of on the collection as a whole.
  :query-from  -> if query is supplied, specifies what form it is in (:clojure, :json, or :mongo).  Defaults to :clojure.
  :sort        -> if you want query sorted (for optimization), specify a map of sort clauses here.
  :sort-from   -> if sort is supplied, specifies what form it is in (:clojure, :json, or :mongo).  Defaults to :clojure.
  :limit       -> the number of objects to return from a query collection (defaults to 0; that is, everything).  This pertains to query, NOT the result of the overall map-reduce job!
  :finalize    -> a finalizaton function (JavaScript, as a String).  Should take two arguments: a key and a single value (not an array of values).
  :scope       -> a scope object; variables in the object will be available in the global scope of map, reduce, and finalize functions.
  :scope-from  -> if scope is supplied, specifies what form it is in (:clojure, :json, or :mongo).  Defaults to :clojure.
  :output      -> if you want the resulting documents from the map-reduce job, specify :documents; otherwise, if you want the name of the result collection as a keyword, specify :collection.
                  Defaults to :documents.  If the value of 'out' is {:inline 1}, you will get documents, regardless of what you actually put here.
  :as          -> if :output is set to :documents, determines the form the results take (:clojure, :json, or :mongo) (has no effect if :output is set to :collection; that is always returned as a Clojure keyword).
